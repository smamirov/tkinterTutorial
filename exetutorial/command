pip install pyinstaller


With ico:
    pyinstaller.exe --onefile --icon=codemy.ico -w entryHeight.py
No ico:
    pyinstaller.exe --onefile -w entryHeight.py


If not icon, just remove that part of the command
Can delete all other files that come loaded in with the executable file
All you need is the executable file for this to work
